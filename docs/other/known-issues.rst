Known Issues
============

-  **Compromised user system:** If the system of the user is compromised
   and accessed by an attacker or if a malicious application is running,
   then the write-ahead logging (WAL) could be accessed and valuable
   information leaked through it, since the WAL is not yet encrypted as
   such: `raiden-network/raiden#579 <https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/issues/579>`__
-  **Disk Full:** The client does not properly handle the cases where
   the userâ€™s disk may be full. This could lead to a loss of data due to
   the Raiden node crashing. In the future, we want to handle the
   detection of a full disk and gracefully quit the app:
   `raiden-network/raiden#675
   <https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/issues/675>`__
-  **Blockchain Congestion:** If the blockchain is congested and there
   is no space for the Raiden node to submit transactions on-chain, the
   client could end up being unable to settle the channel on-chain. The
   development of a gas slot based settlement timeout definition has
   been suggested in order to address blockchain congestion:
   `raiden-network/raiden#383 <https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/issues/383>`__
-  **Chain reorganizations:** The client used to have an issue with edge
   cases of chain reorganizations. These issues have been hot fixed by
   only polling events that are confirmed for 5 blocks. Same applies to
   processing transactions, which are assumed to be valid only after a
   confirmation period of 5 blocks. This results in 15 blocks wait time
   for opening a channel (three on-chain transactions).


**Database Upgrades**
---------------------

The database layout can change between versions. For **patch** and **minor**
change releases, Raiden will do automatic upgrades in the background, as soon as
you start the client with the new version. Your old database will always be kept
as a backup.

However, for **major** change releases, this may not always be possible. If the
client tells you, that the database migration was not possible, you are left with
two options:

- to recover all allocated funds, you should run the previous version of Raiden and
  **close** and **settle** all channels. Afterwards you can move your old database directory
  out of the way and join the network again with the same Ethereum keystore file.

- if there are no funds worth recovering, you can also simply start over with a new
  Ethereum keystore file and
  `start over <https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview_and_guide.html#firing-it-up>`__.
  This should be true for all usage on testnet and in cases where your channel balances
  are very low on mainnet. Don't hesitate to
  `ask for help <https://gitter.im/raiden-network/raiden>`__!
