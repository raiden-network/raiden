Add More Tokens
===============

At some point, you might need to top up your channels with tokens to be able to send more payments. 
You can allocate more tokens by depositing to a channel.

Deposit to a channel
--------------------

Depositing tokens to a specific channel lets you allocate more funds to
that channel. You can compare this to "topping up" a prepaid card.

In the **"Channels"** screen:

1. Click the three dots on the channel where you want to make the
   deposit and choose **"Deposit"**.
2. Enter an amount.
3. Click **"Deposit"**.

The amount you choose will be subtracted from your on-chain token
balance and added to the channel balance.
