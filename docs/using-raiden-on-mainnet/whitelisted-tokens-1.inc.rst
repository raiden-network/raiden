Get Whitelisted Tokens
======================

The Raiden Coruscant release puts a certain
limit on the amount of tokens that can be deposited into a channel. This
is to minimize potential loss of funds in case of bugs.

-  The global limit per token network is approximately **$1000000**.
-  The limit per channel side is approximately **$1000**.

.. note::

   These dollar values of these limits are calculated at contract deployment
   time and vary with the exchange rates of the underlying tokens.
