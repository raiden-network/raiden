Description of the Raiden State Machines

Introduction
============

The current Raiden prototype chose to use hierarchical state machines to represent the internal state of the node. The state of the whole node is a tree that can be serialized on and recovered from the disk. Moreover, whenever the state changes, the change is triggered by a state change object, which can also be serialized on the disk. A snapshot of the state and the subsequent state change objects are enough to compute the current state of the node. That's how a node recovers from crashes.

Kinds of State Machines
=======================

The state of the whole node is represented as a ``ChainState`` object. The ``ChainState`` object contains many other different kinds of objects. This section describes them in a bottom-to-top manner.

This section is still in construction. It contains only the simplest of the state machines.

HashTimeLockState
*****************

A ``HashTimeLockState`` represents a hash time lock.

Attributes of a HashTimeLockState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `the code <https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/blob/f5d48172931ce60c820253e81708acc2a2f49941/raiden/transfer/state.py#L998>`__.

State Changes on a HashTimeLockState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No state changes operate on a ``HashTimeLockState``. A ``HashTimeLockState`` is just added to and removed from :ref:`netting-channel-end-state`.

Other State Machines that Contain a HashTimeLockState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A :ref:`netting-channel-end-state` contains zero-to-many ``HashTimeLockState``.
