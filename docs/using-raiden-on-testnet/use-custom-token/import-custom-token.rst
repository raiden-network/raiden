Import Custom Token
===================

Importing the custom token Solidity code is done via the `Remix Ethereum
IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org/>`__ (Ethereum's integrated development
environment). You can read more about ERC20 tokens in `this GitHub
repo <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20>`__.

1. Start of by getting the Solidity code for an ERC20 token from `this
   GitHub
   gist <https://gist.github.com/eorituz/a779c0277f2fc5c935e2b2f62e49da49>`__.
2. Enter the URL for the `Remix Ethereum
   IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org/>`__ in your browser.
3. Under **"Environments"** click **"Solidity"**.
4. Under **"File"** choose to import from **"Gist"**.
5. In the pop-up that appears enter the ID,
   *a779c0277f2fc5c935e2b2f62e49da49*, of the gist you just viewed.

If the import was successful you should be able to open the imported
code from the file explorer on the left hand side menu.
