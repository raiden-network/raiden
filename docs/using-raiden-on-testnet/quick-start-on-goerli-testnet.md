# Quick Start on Görli Testnet

You might want to try out Raiden on a testnet before using it on mainnet or might need a development environment. For this reasons we provide a stable demo environment on Görli. The quickest way to get a Raiden node set up on this environment is to use the Raiden Wizard for Görli. This page will guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>

In order to use the Raiden Wizard and Raiden you'll need:

* A computer running **Linux** or **macOS**.
* An Infura ID. Click [here](../installation/quick-start/infura-quick-start.md) to get one.

## Download the Wizard

Click on your operating system to download the Wizard:

* [macOS](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-wizard/releases/download/v1.1.0/raiden_wizard_goerli_macOS-1.1.0.tar.gz)
* [Linux](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-wizard/releases/download/v1.1.0/raiden_wizard_goerli_linux-1.1.0.tar.gz)

## Run the Wizard

1. Extract and run the `raiden_wizard` program.
2. Your web browser should open a new window with the Raiden Wizard. If not, you can manually type [`http://localhost:2640`](http://localhost:2640) to access the Wizard.

The Raiden Wizard will do the following for you:

* Create a new Ethereum Account \(the "Raiden Account"\) specifically for using with the Wizard.
* Fund this new Raiden Account with ETH from a faucet.
* Mint `SVT` tokens for using the pathfinding and monitoring services.
* Mint `WIZ` tokens for making payments in the Raiden Network.
* Launch your Raiden node.

Note that the Görli Wizard uses test tokens, so don’t be confused by the RDN and DAI symbols.
{% endhint %}

## Next steps

After the completion of the Wizard you will get redirected to the web interface of your Raiden node. See [this page](../the-raiden-web-interface/screens.md) for a guide to the interface.

You can try to do your first payment by opening a channel with the [Raiden Hub](https://hub.raiden.network/) `0x1F916ab5cf1B30B22f24Ebf435f53Ee665344Acf` and sending some WIZ tokens to it. The payment should show up on the hub's [webpage](https://hub.raiden.network).

## Restart your Raiden node

After you have shut down your Raiden node, the Raiden Wizard can be used as a launcher for your node. When you start the Wizard, it will recognise that you already created a configuration for your node and show a "Launch" button.
