Introduction

This is a general onboarding guide whose main purpose is to help people who want to develop Raiden. It provides an in-depth explanation of the protocol followed by an explanation of the architecture.

The Raiden Protocol
===================

In this section we will have the general explanation of how the Raiden protocol works, starting from the smart contracts and ending with the offchain messages that are exchanged between Raiden nodes.
For a more formal definition of the protocol please refer to the `specification <https://raiden-network-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
