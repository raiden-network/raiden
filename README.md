Raiden Network is a proposed extension to Ethereum which scales-out asset transfer capacity.

It's inspired by the Lightning Network which leverages off-chain asset transfers to carry out the vast majority of transactions.

This is work in progress.

### Versions and releases

Currently we aim to create proof of concept releases weekly, not based on a certain
feature level. All proof of concept releases will have version numbers in the
`0.0.x` range (so `PoC-1` = `0.0.1`).

#### Developer notice:

To create a proof of concept release, install [`bumpversion`](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion)
and call

```
prepare_poc_release.sh
```

This will bump the version and create a commit on a new branch `poc_release_{version}`,
which will be pushed to the upstream repository and create a PR.

Once your PR is merged you can call:

```
release.sh
```
