settings:
  ## Mail notification address - needs a mailgun api key to be given on the command line
  #notify: "raiden-scenario-basic@example.com"

  ## Gas price to use, either `fast`, `medium` or an integer (in gwei)
  gas_price: "fast"

  ## Chain to use
  ## Named chains given on the scenario player command line
  ## Defaults to 'any' - use any available one
  #chain: any
  ## Other examples
  #chain: ropsten
  #chain: kovan
  #chain: rinkeby
  #chain: raiden_clique
  #chain: raiden_aura

  ## Services
  ## Define services to be used, if any. Defined here to allow assertions on PFS state.
  ## PFS URL can optionally be overridden in node options.
#  services:
#    pfs:
#      url: https://pfs-kovan.services-dev.raiden.network
#    udc:
#      enable: true
#      ## Optionally override UDC address
#      #address:
#      token:
#        deposit: true

token:
  ## To use an existing token give an address
  #address: "0xabcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01"

  ## To deploy a new one remove the `address` key
  ## Optionally parameters: give name and symbol, both will be autogenerated if not given
  ## name - Token name, default: autogenerated
  ## symbol - Token symbol, default: autogenerated
  ## decimals - Token decimals, default: 0
  ## balance_min - Minimum node balance, default: 5000
  ## reuse - remember the token and reuse it for the next run of this scenario, default: false
  #name: "Some token"
  #symbol: "STKN"
  #decimals: 18
  #balance_min: 5000
  #reuse: true

nodes:
  ## Mode, either `managed` or `external`
  # - managed: The scenario player will manage the Raiden nodes
  # - external: The nodes need to be managed externally (see v1 for examples)
  mode: managed
  count: 3
  ## Raiden version to use, default: 'LATEST' uses the latest nightly release
  #raiden_version: LATEST
  #raiden_version: v0.12.0
  ## Options to apply to all nodes
  ## Option names correspond to Raiden cli options without the leading double dash (`--`)
  default_options:
    gas-price: fast
    # environment-type: development
    #registry-contract-address: "0xbfa863Ac58a3E0A82B58a8e958F2752Bfb573388"
