    #   then it's revealed (meaning that the attacker is losing token, that's why
    #   it's using the lowest possible amount)
    # - C wants the token from B, it will reveal the secret and close the channel
    #   (because it must assume the balance proof won't make in time and it needs
    #   to unlock on-chain)

    # Mitigation:
    #
    # - C should only close the channel B-C if he has paid A2, since this may
    #   only happen if the lock for the transfer C-A2 has not yet expired then C
    #   has enough time to follow the protocol without closing the channel B-C.
