# This is the BF5 scenario. It sets up a simple topology of two nodes and then uses
# `join_network` to add more nodes to the network. It tests that nodes can join the network
# with nodes that didn't use `join_network` themselves and that nodes that used `join_network`
# also deposit in new channels when other nodes open channels with them. Finally it also
# tests that nodes using `leave_network` have all their open channels closed, when doing so.
