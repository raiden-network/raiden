# This is the bf4 scenario. It sets up a topology of [ [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [0, 4, 5] ]
# with deposits in the directions starting from node0 going towards node2, node3 and node5.
# When the channels are opened with deposits, 100 payments from node0 should be started
# simultaneously to node2, node3 and node5.
# When the payments are done assertions make sure that all payments went through and that balances are correct.
