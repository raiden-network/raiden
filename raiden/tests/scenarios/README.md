## Scenarios

The scenarios listed within this folder are getting executed nightly by the [scenario player](https://github.com/raiden-network/scenario-player/) or can be executed locally after installing the scenario player.

## Purpose

The scenarios serve the following purpose

- Full end-to-end tests covering contracts, transport, Raiden client, blockchain, eth-client, monitoring service, pathfinding service and service contracts
- Testing on a "dirty" blockchain
- User acceptance tests
- Testing in a distributed environment
- Understanding how Raiden and the Raiden Services can be used and interact

## Scenarios

#### [bf1_basic_functionality](./bf1_basic_functionality.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4. From here the basic functionality of channels are tested.
Payments without and with enough capacity are made. Several payments from different initiators and receivers are made.
Checks to verify that the PFS works as intended take place. The partial withdraw and deposit functionality is tested.
It is also tested that a node can be stopped and started again and that it still functions as expected after this.
Several nodes perform up to 100 payments.
In the end it is tested that channels can be closed and that the monitoring service correctly kicks in if a node is offline during closing.

#### [ms1_simple_monitoring](./ms1_simple_monitoring.yaml)

A channel between two nodes is opened, a transfer is made. Then, node1 goes offline
and node0 closes the channel. The asserts checks whether the monitoring service interferes and received its reward.

#### [ms2_simple_monitoring](./ms2_simple_monitoring.yaml)

A channel between two nodes is opened, a transfer is made. Then, node1 goes offline and node0 closes the channel. Node1 does not get back online in time and cannot update the channel info by herself. The monitoring services interferes and gets its reward. After the monitoring trigger block is passed node1 gets back online.

#### [ms3_simple_monitoring](./ms3_simple_monitoring.yaml)

A channel between two nodes is opened, a transfer is made. Then, node1 goes offline and node0 closes the channel. Before the monitoring trigger block is passed node1 gets back online. Node1 calls the smart contract itself and therefore the MS does not get triggered.

#### [pfs1_get_a_simple_path](./pfs1_get_a_simple_path.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and checks whether a path is returned.

#### [pfs2_simple_no_path](./pfs2_simple_no_path.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 and checks that no path is returned since there is no capacity in the direction from 3 to 0.

#### [pfs3_multiple_paths](./pfs3_multiple_paths.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 3 and checks whether two paths are returned.

#### [pfs4_use_best_path](./pfs4_use_best_path.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 2 and checks whether the best path is the one used for the payment. 
Note that `max-paths` is set to 1 path.

#### [pfs5_too_low_capacity](./pfs5_too_low_capacity.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 3, where 0 <-> 4 <-> 3 doesn't have enough capacity to make a second transfer after one transfer is made and hence the other path is used for that transfer. This also checks that the PFS reacts correctly to the capacity update.
Note that `max-paths` is set to 1 path.

#### [pfs6_simple_path_rewards](./pfs6_simple_path_rewards.yaml)

It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and performs some transfers in order to check that IOUs are created for the PFS that provides the path.
