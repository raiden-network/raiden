## This scenario tests that the MS does not kick in, if the node requesting monitoring does
## not have enough funds deposited in the UDC. A channel is opened between node0 and node1.
## A couple of transfers take place and node1 then goes offline. Node0 calls close and node1
## stays offline. It is then expected that the MS does not kick in, since node1 does not have
## enough tokens deposited.
