## This is the PFS9 scenario. It aims to make sure that the PFS reacts correctly to balance updates 
## after a partial withdraw takes place.
## A topology of 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 3 will be used.
## Node0 will first make a payment to node3 through [0, 4, 3] and then node4 makes a partial withdraw
## results in not enough capacity for a second transfer to be routes through that path.
## The expected path for the second transfer is then [0, 1, 2, 3].
