# This is the bf3 scenario. It sets up a topology of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and deposits in both directions between all nodes.
# When all channels are opened and deposits have taken place, 100 payments are started from node0 to node4
# At the same time 100 payments are done in parallel from node4 to node0.
# After all payments have finished it is asserted that all nodes received the correct amounts.
