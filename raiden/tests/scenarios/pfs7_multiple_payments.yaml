## This scenario sets up a topology of [0, 1, 2, 3] and [0, 4, 3] with deposits in both directions.
## 100 payments is then carried out and assertions are made to ensure the PFS gets the corrects amount
## of requests and IOUs. During the transfers the [0, 4, 3] path will have too low capacity and the other one
## should be used.
