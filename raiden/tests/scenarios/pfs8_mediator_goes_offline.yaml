## This is the PFS8 scenario. It aims to make sure that the PFS reacts correctly if a node along
## a path goes offline and thus provides a new path if one is available.
## A topology of 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 3 will be used.
## Node0 will first make a payment to node3 through [0, 4, 3] and then node4 goes offline. It is
## then expected that the path [0, 1, 2, 3] is used instead.
