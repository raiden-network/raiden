    This event is used once the secret is known locally and an action must be
    performed on the receiver:

        - For receivers in the payee role, it informs the node that the lock has
        been released and the token can be withdrawn, either on-chain or
        off-chain.
        - For receivers in the payer role, it tells the payer that the payee
        knows the secret and wants to withdraw the lock off-chain, so the payer
        may unlock the lock and send an up-to-date balance proof to the payee,
        avoiding on-chain payments which would require the channel to be
        closed.

    For any mediated transfer:

        - The initiator will only perform the payer role.
        - The target will only perform the payee role.
        - The mediators will have `n` channels at the payee role and `n` at the
          payer role, where `n` is equal to `1 + number_of_refunds`.

    Note:
        The payee must only update its local balance once the payer sends an
        up-to-date balance-proof message. This is a requirement for keeping the
        nodes synchronized. The reveal secret message flows from the receiver
        to the sender, so when the secret is learned it is not yet time to
        update the balance.
