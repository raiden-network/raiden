    """ True if the side-effect of `transaction` is satisfied by
    `state_change`.

    This predicate is used to clear the transaction queue. This should only be
    done once the expected side effect of a transaction is achieved. This
    doesn't necessarily mean that the transaction sent by *this* node was
    mined, but only that *some* transaction which achieves the same side-effect
    was successfully executed and mined. This distinction is important for
    restarts and to reduce the number of state changes.

    On restarts: The state of the on-chain channel could have changed while the
    node was offline. Once the node learns about the change (e.g. the channel
    was settled), new transactions can be dispatched by Raiden as a side effect for the
    on-chain *event* (e.g. do the batch unlock with the latest merkle tree),
    but the dispatched transaction could have been completed by another agent (e.g.
    the partner node). For these cases, the transaction from a different
    address which achieves the same side-effect is sufficient, otherwise
    unnecessary transactions would be sent by the node.

    NOTE: The above is not important for transactions sent as a side-effect for
    a new *block*. On restart the node first synchronizes its state by querying
    for new events, only after the off-chain state is up-to-date, a Block state
    change is dispatched. At this point some transactions are not required
    anymore and therefore are not dispatched.

    On the number of state changes: Accepting a transaction from another
    address removes the need for clearing state changes, e.g. when our the
    node's close transaction fails but its partner's close transaction
    succeeds.

    required by the local transaction is executed before it.

        transaction will transition the channel to a closed state which doesn't
        allow for deposits (different end state).

        A settle transaction cannot invalidate a deposit because a settle is
        only allowed for the closed state and deposits are only allowed for
        the open state. In such a case a deposit should never have been sent.
