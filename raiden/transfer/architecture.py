# Quick overview
# --------------
#
# Goals:
# - Reliable failure recovery.
#
# Approach:
# - Use a write-ahead-log for state changes. Under a node restart the
# latest state snapshot can be recovered and the pending state changes
# reaplied.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function call `state_transition(curr_state, state_change)` must be
# deterministic, the recovery depends on the re-execution of the state changes
# from the WAL and must produce the same result.
# - StateChange must be idempotent because the partner node might be recovering
# from a failure and a Event might be produced more than once.
#
# Requirements that are enforced:
# - A state_transition function must not produce a result that must be further
# processed, i.e. the state change must be self contained and the result state
# tree must be serializable to produce a snapshot. To enforce this inputs and
# outputs are separated under different class hierarquies (StateChange and Event).
