    This is resolving a corner case where the current node view of the channel
    state does not reflect what the blockchain contains. E.g. for a channel
    A->B:

    - A sends a LockedTransfer to B
    - B sends a Refund to A
    - B goes offline
    - A sends a LockExpired to B
      Here:
      (1) the lock is removed from A's state
      (2) B never received the message
    - A closes the channel with B's refund
    - Here a few things may happen:
      (1) B never cames back online, and updateTransfer is never called.
      (2) B is using monitoring services, which use the known LockExpired
          balance proof.
      (3) B cames back online and aclls updateTransfer with the LockExpired
          message (For some transports B will never receive the LockExpired message
          because the channel is closed already, and message retries may be
          disabled).
    - When channel is settled A must query the blockchain to figure out which
      locksroot was used.
