    """ Matrix user <-> eth address mapping and user / address reachability helper.

    In Raiden the smallest unit of addressability is a node with an associated Ethereum address.
    In Matrix it's a user. Matrix users are (at the moment) bound to a specific homeserver.
    Since we want to provide resiliency against unavailable homeservers a single Raiden node with
    a single Ethereum address can be in control over multiple Matrix users on multiple homeservers.

    Therefore we need to perform a many-to-one mapping of Matrix users to Ethereum addresses.
    Each Matrix user has a presence state (ONLINE, OFFLINE).
    One of the preconditions of running a Raiden node is that there can always only be one node
    online for a particular address at a time.
    That means we can synthesize the reachability of an address from the user presence states.

    This helper internally tracks both the user presence and address reachability for addresses
    that have been marked as being 'interesting' (by calling the `.add_address()` method).
    Additionally it provides the option of passing callbacks that will be notified when
    presence / reachability change.
